==JLC==
This is a compiler for Javalette (a minimized version of Java) that compiles to jvm or llvm bytecode.
It also includes a very simple IDE called JLDE for developing Javalette code.
It is programmed by David Sundelius and Olof Kamp for a project
in the course in compiler construction on Chalmers University of
Technology in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden.

See LICENCE.txt for more licencing issues.
